## Overview of Project

I use a screen reader every day for surfing the web and work. I hate how bad most voices are in screen readers, but I did not want to have a monthly subscription for a good screen reader. This extension currently works on the XTTS API Server backend, which cannot stream audio over the network as I had hoped. I wanted to deploy this on my network to use on all of my computers. I am in the process of moving this to AllTalk, but it is taking longer than expected.

## Setup

### After Installing XTTS API Server

- Put your audio clips into the speaker folder. The name you give the WAV file will be the name that shows up in the extension. For example, `Bob.wav` will show up as Bob.

### After Installing the Chrome Extension

1. Pin the extension to the top for easy access.
2. Click on it, and you will see the server IP field. You can enter `localhost` or the subnet IP address of your server (e.g., `192.168.1.100`).
3. Click "Save".
4. Click "Refresh List" to load all your voices.
5. Select a voice or voice set from the dropdown.
6. Click "Load Selection".

### Setting Up the Dictionary

If you encounter words that the TTS engine mispronounces:

1. Switch to the Dictionary tab.
2. Enter the word in the "Word" field.
3. Enter the phonetic spelling in the "Pronunciation" field.
4. Click "Add" to save to your dictionary.
5. The next time this word appears in text, it will automatically be replaced with your phonetic version.

## Known Issues

1. It only plays audio on the PC it's running on, not through the browser (this is why I am moving to a new backend).
2. It has all the odd issues any audio played through XTTS would have.
3. Text in brackets "()" is skipped; I am working on this.
4. The UI needs improvement.

## Voices

I cannot release the voices in the demo due to copyright reasons. You will have to add your own. These clips need to be clean audio of at least 10 seconds, though most of mine are 30 seconds. I like to use Audacity to cut out large silent parts. Additionally, a well-finetuned XTTS2 model really helps.

## Technical Details

The extension uses Chrome's storage API to save:
- Server IP address
- Selected voice/set
- Custom voice sets (playlists)
- Custom dictionary entries
- UI theme preference

Text preprocessing pipeline:
1. Dictionary word replacement (using custom phonetic spellings)
2. Abbreviation expansion (e.g., "Dr." â†’ "Doctor")
3. Parentheses handling (keeping content with natural pauses)
4. Special character and URL handling
5. Natural pauses after sentence-ending punctuation
